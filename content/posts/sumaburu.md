## Local Multiplayer Sumo Fighting Action!

Solo project made from a love of local multiplayer and weird control schemes.

Two sumo fighters duke it out in the ring! Punch left, punch right, push each other out of the ring to emerge victorious.

Play against a computer or a friend with local multiplayer on the same keyboard and multi-controller support. I recommend Switch Joycons using BetterJoy.
