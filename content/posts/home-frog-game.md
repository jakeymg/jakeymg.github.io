## Turn Based RPG based on collecting and using Monster Abilites

An ambitious project I want to come back to at some point. I got a pretty fun paper prototype set-up that works as a single player boardgame.

<!--more-->

Two strange ships have crash landed on earth, a bizzare scientist, and some aliens chasing him! Strange technology has changed objects on earth into dangerous creatures, and turned you into a frog boy. With the help of some odd balls you use these new creatures abilities against them and get to the bottom of why the aliens are here and how to change yourself back.
