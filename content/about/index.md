I’m Jacob (feel free to call me Jakey), a UI/UX Designer with over seven years of full-time experience creating and designing experiences for web apps, mobile apps, and games!

This is my website to serve as a portfolio of creative work, both paid and personal.

Self-motivated and always learning, I welcome new challenges.

At University I studied Journalism and Arts, but when it comes to work, I feel like all the skills I've used and learnt are self-taught. I learn best by doing, and through doing I've learnt a lot about what I'm interested in and good at.
