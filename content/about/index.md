I’m Jacob (feel free to call me Jakey), a UI/UX Designer with over seven years of full-time experience creating intuitive experiences for web, mobile apps, and games!

Self-motivated and always learning, I welcome new challenges. In my spare time, I work on creative projects – some of which I have shared down below.

I’m excited to transition my UI/UX skills to the games industry, designing engaging experiences and growing in game-specific UI/UX.
